the point of this this program is to simulate the experimental laser lab allowing for material desgin and future measurements 

createData.py - create the optical parameters of ws2 and wse2 at low tempetures by taking room tempture data, fitting the data to extract optical params, then changing the params based on papers, then using the new params we create low tempeture optical parameters.

extractorRC.py - is measuring tool need to extract engery shifts during AC optcial stark shift, the code provided uses simulated data in order test accuracy.
